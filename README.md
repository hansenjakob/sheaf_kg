# A Sheaf Theoretic Framework for Knoweldge Graph Embedding

Models are written to be compatible with the
[Pykeen package](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

The primary Sheaf-specific models may be found in `sheaf_kg/sheafE_models.py`.
These models can be trained via `sheaf_kg/train_sheafE.py`. The rest of the
files are either deprecated or in progress of being refactored. The notebooks
are mostly scratch work at this point. 

Dependencies:
- pykeen
- pytorch
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
